# Instructions

### First Create a config.php
Please Remember that config.php file is missing. You need to create your own config.php file and it should be in the root directory of your project. Reference code for config.php is given below.

```PHP
  <?php
    define('HOST', 'localhost');
    define('DB', 'dbms_lab_project_help');
    define('USER', 'root');
    define('PASSWORD', '');
  ?>
```
